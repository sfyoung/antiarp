This is an antiarp module of linux kernel. The principle is simple: send your
arp ack package to the gateway. Because of the mechanism and strategy problem,
This module should not add to kernel.
You can compile and load it as follows:
1. $ make
2. # insmod antiarp.ko

Note: The count of arp package is set to be 10000, you can increase it manually.

Remove it as follows:
# rmmod antiarp
Just for fun.
